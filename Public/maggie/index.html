    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p>
      Maggie is 3.5 yrs old in the photograph above and is a rescue from South
      Carolina. She is the happiest dog I have ever met and brings a lot of joy
      into our home. Maggie is a mixed breed, Husky, Lab and German Shepherd.
      Very close to an Alaskin Husky. Lots and lots of energy.

          <li>
            Maggie loves to hike and sniff and is like my uphill motor. Going
            down a slope I ask her to "go easy" and she slows down. What a good
            dog.
