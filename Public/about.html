    <p>
      I have always been amazed by electricity. As a child I enjoyed listening
      to my brother's shortwave radio. All those different sounds and broadcasts
      in many languages captured by a simple wire antenna strung out to a nearby
      tree. It seemed like magic

      I was lucky enough to spend my entire high school years at a full-time
      Vo-tech for Electricity and in 1979 I started my apprenticeship. Worked my
      way up to Journeyman then Master Electrician. As technology advanced so
      did I and went to college at night to earn an associateâ€™s degree in
      electronics and then back again from a certificate in networking.

      It's been a lifetime of learning and between work and hobbies I have
      worked with everything from single board computers to high voltage power.
      My list of things to learn keeps growing.
